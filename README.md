# Recursion Assignment
This project contains 2 assignments for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). They are part of the basic Computer Science part of the Ruby full stack path.

## Assignment 1: Fibonacci
Assignment 1 required me to create a method that gives the n-th number in the fibonacci sequence.

First it had to be created using a loop, afterwards using a recursive method.

## Assignment 2: Merge Sort
Assignment 2 required me to study how the merge sorting algorithm worked, and afterwards requested me to implement a version in ruby.

I started with some information on merge sorting, then setup the base case; and the recursion steps. 
At the end i setup the actual merging step, which i've interated over a few times; ending up with a method that merges the halves by looping over the halves until both are empty.
